    "unesco_first_text" : "The guiding principle of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) is that: \"Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed\". It says this in the Preamble to its Constitution. As an autonomous organisation within the UNO system, UNESCO works by supporting education, science, culture, communication and information in order to preserve peace, fight poverty and promote sustainable development and intercultural dialogue. UNESCO is a global forum for intellectual cooperation and for the sharing of information, experience and ideas.",
    "unesco_second_title" : "World Heritage as a revolutionary idea",
    "unesco_second_text" : "What Nature has created over millions or thousands of years, and what humans have built up over the centuries, should be preserved. Protecting and preserving these treasures should be made the responsibility of all mankind – that is the central, revolutionary idea of World Heritage. It was the rescue of the temple of Abu Simbel that gave rise to the UNESCO Convention in 1972, in which a commitment was made to protect the world's cultural and natural heritage. \n\nNearly 1000 properties have now been added to the World Heritage list, including eleven in Switzerland. They are all of outstanding universal value, such as the Pyramids in Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador or Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon in the USA.",
    "unesco_third_title" : "Sustainability as a reality in biosphere reserves",
    "unesco_third_text" : "Biosphere reserves are model regions where sustainable development is put into practice every day. Here, residents and entrepreneurs attempt to find an equilibrium between ecological responsibility, economic success and social solidarity. Real sustainable development meets the requirements of the present day. At the same time, it ensures that the needs of future generations will also be satisfied. In Switzerland, there are two biosphere reserves: the Val Müstair Parc Naziunal in the canton of Graubünden and the Entlebuch region in the canton of Lucerne. \n\nA summons to mankind: We are all called upon to take care of our precious heritage and hand it over safely to future generations – UNESCO is here to help.",
